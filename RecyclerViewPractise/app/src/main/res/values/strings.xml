    TheGRIA aims to equip 50 million children and young people to become climate conscious,
    adaptable, and resilient by 2030.
    This coalition is galvanizing private organizations, foundations,
    youth networks, multilaterals, and the Government of India to unify
    their commitment to sharing knowledge, efforts, and innovative solutions.
    The primary goal is to equip young people with the requisite opportunities
    not only to embrace a climate-conscious mindset but also to foster resilience,
    thereby enabling them to fully realize their potential. This alliance will
    further synergize investments, strategic priorities, and portfolios of work
    to unlock unprecedented opportunities to complement national efforts with the
    government and young people.
    Dhuwarakha Sriram, chief of generation unlimited in India (YuWaah), Youth
    Development and Partnerships at UNICEF said: “YuWaah at UNICEF has brought
    together key stakeholders for the Green Rising India Alliance and through this
    strategic collaboration we commit to co-creating sustainable and impactful
    contribution to the urgent cause of climate action. Together, we will nurture
    youth-led action in India and bring new energy to our collective initiatives
    to foster innovative and inclusive solutions, at scale to multiply our impact.
    We recognise the power of young people as the changemakers in combatting Climate
    Change and supporting Environmental Sustainability and thus we are partnering to
    further build their potential and create
    opportunities for and with them to lead on issues that matter the most to them.”</string>
